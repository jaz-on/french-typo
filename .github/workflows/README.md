# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository includes three GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration, release management, and deployment.

## CI

The CI workflow runs automated checks on every push to `main` and on pull requests.

### Triggers

- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests (any branch)

### Jobs

#### PHP Lint

- Checks PHP syntax for all `.php` files (excluding `vendor/`)
- Uses PHP 8.3
- Fails if any PHP file has syntax errors

#### WordPress Coding Standards

- Runs PHPCS with `WordPress-Extra` standard
- Validates code against WordPress coding standards
- Requires Composer dependencies to be installed
- Uses PHP 8.3

### Usage

The workflow runs automatically on push and pull requests. No manual action required.

## Create Release ZIP

This workflow automatically creates a clean distribution ZIP for each release, excluding development files according to `.distignore`.

### Triggers

The workflow runs when:
- A release is created (`release: created`)
- A release is edited (`release: edited`)
- It is manually dispatched (`workflow_dispatch`) with a specific tag

**Note:** Tag pushes do not trigger this workflow (by design).

### How it works

1. **Version verification:** Checks that the plugin header `Version` matches the release tag
2. **Checkout:** Checks out the code at the provided release tag
3. **Build ZIP:** Creates a clean ZIP using `.distignore` to exclude:
   - Git files (`.git/`, `.gitignore`, etc.)
   - Development docs (`README.md`, `TODO.md`, changelogs, etc.)
   - Build/test directories and scripts
   - Composer metadata and `vendor/`
   - The `.github/` directory and other CI/config files
4. **Verification:** Verifies the ZIP does not contain excluded files
5. **Release notes:** Generates release notes from `readme.txt` changelog, including:
   - Changelog entries for the version
   - Contributors list
   - Statistics (commits, files changed, additions/deletions)
   - Comparison link to previous release
6. **Upload:** Uploads the ZIP as a release asset and updates release notes

### Expected ZIP contents (key items)

- `french-typo.php` — Main plugin file
- `readme.txt` — WordPress.org readme
- `LICENSE` — GPLv2 or later
- `admin.css` — Admin styles

The final contents are determined by what is not excluded by `.distignore`.

### Usage

To create a new release with an automatic ZIP:

1. Create a tag: `git tag -a 1.1.0 -m "Release 1.1.0"`
2. Push the tag: `git push origin 1.1.0`
3. Create or edit the release on GitHub (UI or `gh release create`)
4. The workflow will run and attach the clean ZIP to the release

Alternatively, run it manually (`workflow_dispatch`) and provide the `tag` input.

### Optional WordPress.org deployment

When manually dispatching, you can set `deploy_to_wporg` to `true` to trigger the deployment job. This job:
- Verifies version consistency between tag, plugin header, and `readme.txt` stable tag
- Prepares for deployment (currently scaffolded, requires configuration)

**Note:** The actual deployment step is commented out and requires:
- SVN credentials (`SVN_USERNAME`, `SVN_PASSWORD` secrets)
- Plugin slug configuration
- Uncommenting the `10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy` step

### Verification

The workflow performs multiple checks:
- Plugin header version matches the tag
- ZIP does not contain excluded files (composer files, dev docs, `.github/`, etc.)
- If deployment is requested, stable tag in `readme.txt` must match the release tag

If any check fails, the job fails with a clear error message.

## Deploy to WordPress.org (manual)

This workflow provides a manual deployment scaffold for WordPress.org.

### Triggers

- Manual dispatch only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Requires a `version` input (tag name, e.g., `v1.0.0`)

### How it works

1. Validates that the provided tag exists
2. Shows deployment instructions and required secrets
3. Currently scaffolded — requires configuration to enable actual deployment

### Required secrets

To enable deployment, configure these secrets in GitHub repository settings:

- `SVN_USERNAME` — WordPress.org SVN username
- `SVN_PASSWORD` — WordPress.org SVN password (or use `SVN_TOKEN` instead)
- `SLUG` — Plugin slug on WordPress.org (e.g., `french-typo`)

### Assets structure

The workflow expects WordPress.org assets in `.wordpress-org/`:
- Plugin icons: `icon-128x128.png`, `icon-256x256.png`, `icon.svg`
- Screenshots: `screenshot-1.png` (and more if needed)

These will be automatically copied to `assets/` at SVN root level by the deploy action.

### Usage

1. Go to Actions → "Deploy to WordPress.org (manual)"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the version/tag to deploy (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
4. Run the workflow

**Note:** This workflow is currently a scaffold. To enable actual deployment:
1. Configure the required secrets
2. Uncomment and configure the `10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy` step
3. See: https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy

### Alternative: Integrated deployment

The `create-release-zip.yml` workflow includes an optional `deploy-to-wporg` job that can be triggered when manually dispatching with `deploy_to_wporg: true`. This provides version verification before deployment.
